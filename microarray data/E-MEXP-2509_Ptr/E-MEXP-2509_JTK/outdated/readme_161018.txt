ran JTK on .txt file ending with "_controls_PCA", as it contains the normalised read counts for gene expression
created JTK.E-MEXP-2509, and copied and renamed the copy as JTK.pop_tri as this makes it easier for downstream
heatmap and line graph (gene frequencies) generation

E-MEXP-2509_combined_PCA_editJTK.txt is modified from E-MEXP-2509_combined_PCA.txt, but timepoints shifted so that
they are in order for JTK
JTK.pop_tri_edit.txt produced by JTK output

JTK.pop_tri_edit.txt has timepoints shifted so that 2 days are collapsed into 1

These are outdated as the gene IDs are wrong.
