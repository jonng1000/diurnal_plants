This folder contains scripts to process array information to make it suitable to blast/diamond
array probe sequences against a CDS file, and the blast and diamond outputs.

However, diamond is not good as its e-values are low. Probably due to the fact that it uses blastx to
translate array probe nt sequence before searching against the peptide database, so the matches are
not so good. blastn searches my array probes against the nt database, so its matches are more accurate.

Use blastn for all future work now.

1) zma_matches.txt is diamond output so ignore
2) A-GEOD-10837_pre.txt is obtained from A-GEOD-10837.adf.txt
3) explore_bmatches_diamond.py and explore_bmatches.py can be used to compare difference betwee
blast and diamond output.
4) results.out is the full blast output, but not needed
5) results_tab.txt is selected blast output in tab-delimited format, used for my purposes.
