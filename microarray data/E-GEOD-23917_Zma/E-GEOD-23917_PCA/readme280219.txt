For guidance on how to recreate these files, can look in the outdated folder since the general 
content of those files are correct, its only the gene IDs which are outdated.

~60 000 genes from cds file, but only about ~30 000 probes map to these genes. Out of them,
some probes map to the same genes, hence removed duplicates by only keeping the first gene.
reaosn: easier to code this in python.

~20 000 genes are left in expression matrix.
