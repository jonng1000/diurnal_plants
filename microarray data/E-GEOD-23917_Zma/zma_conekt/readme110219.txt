1) Species description
Zea mays, also know as maize or corn, is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico 
about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate 
ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits.

Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize 
surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, little of this maize is consumed directly by humans: most is 
used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. 
The six major types of maize are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.

2) JTK.zea_may_edit2.txt is made by hand from JTK.zea_may_edit.txt (located in JTK folder), where all
timepoints are collasped into 24 h. zma_modified.txt is made by hand from JTK.zea_may_edit2.txt, with
all JTK specific info removed.

gene_ex_annotation.txt is made by hand from zma_modified.txt.

All the above manually made so that I don't have to write a brand new script to do it. Previous script
doesn't work as the format of the day/night timepoints are different from the other data sets.
