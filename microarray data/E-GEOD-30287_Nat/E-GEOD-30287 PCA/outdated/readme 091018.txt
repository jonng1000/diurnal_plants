steps to do PCA plot
1) copy and paste header of gene expression matrix (time points) and transpose it into  E-GEOD-30287_colourbar_PRE
2) convert these timepoints into L and D (light and day) categories and paste them into gene expression matrix_PCA file
assign colour bar values (1-24)
3) run timepoints_in_cols.py script to transpose these converted time points and add decimals for replicates,
then assign colour bar values (1-24) in _colorbar file.
4) use this _colorbar file together with PCA plotting script to generate one PCA plot for this matrix
5) _colorbar_PRE may not always be needed, used only when I need to further manually process the time points before it is
appropriate for use in a colour bar

E-GEOD-30287_combined.txt is not the file for PCA plotting, as last three time points are the earliest time points.
Hence have shifted them to the start of matrix, and have saved this correct matrix as E-GEOD-30287_combined_PCA.txt

These are outdated as the gene IDs are wrong.
