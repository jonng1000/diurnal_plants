2) Sequences
First ID I see in CDS and peptide fasta files is the transcript ID, need to go find something 
like gene:A4A49_09758 which gives me the correct gene ID

3) tissue-specificity: There's only 2 dark periods of 4h and 8h, hence eliminated midnight, and 
extended noon, which has 6 time points now.
