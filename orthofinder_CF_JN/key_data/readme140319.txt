started reconciling trees: 12pm - finished about 7.20pm -> crashed due to data being too long for column
started reconciling trees: 10pm - finished about 8.10am -> crashed due to timeout error

Change data type for column
Problem is: data_phyloxml = db.Column(db.Text)
But there's no LONGTEXT datatype for flask, although it would theoretically solve the problem

Use the following commands, and the associated outputs should be seen
MariaDB [diurnal]> DESCRIBE trees;

timeout error:
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (2006, "MySQL server has gone away (ConnectionAbortedError

possible cause is packet size is too large, default is 16MB

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/server-system-variables/#max_allowed_packet

Set packet size to be bigger, max is 1GB, but mysql commands below doesnt work
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/packet-too-large.html
Need to use the MariaDB ones

In MySQLClient(MariaDB):
Orignal max_allowed_packet variable is 10485760

show variables like 'max_allowed_packet';
 max_allowed_packet | 1073741824

can also use this command
SELECT @@max_allowed_packet;

Change max_allowed_packet to 1GB
SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=1073741824;
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8062496/how-to-change-max-allowed-packet-size

Close window, then open it and check max_allowed_packet size to make sure its changed.
Need to do this step for the change to take effect.

Above doesn't work, Conekt still crashes, also at ~12h after starting reconciliation of tress
Implemented Marek's solution to remove a few hundred of the largest tree files, works,
reconciling tress now takes ~3h.

redo, format is :0.01 to define branch length leading to clade -> do not add comma at the end of
this number if its not there
