1) Species description
Picea abies, the Norway spruce or European spruce, is a species of spruce 
native to Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. It has branchlets that typically 
hang downwards, and the largest cones of any spruce, 9–17 cm long. 
It is very closely related to the Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), which replaces 
it east of the Ural Mountains, and with which it hybridises freely. The Norway spruce is 
widely planted for its wood, and is the species used as the main Christmas tree in several 
cities around the world. It was the first gymnosperm to have its genome sequenced, and one 
clone has been measured as 9,560 years old.
