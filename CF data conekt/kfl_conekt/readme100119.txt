1) Species description
Klebsormidium is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae comprising 20 species. 
The name was proposed in 1972 to resolve confusion in application and status of Hormidium. 
It occurs mostly in soil and on moist substrates, nevertheless, aquatic and one marine species 
are also known. Many Klebsormidium-species are able to synthesize substances for UV protection, 
the so-called mycosporine-like amino acids.

2) For the cds and peptide files, initially removed _v1.1 from gene IDs, which is wrong as they should have been
left there. Hence had to recreate these files, and shift outdated downstream outputs into the outdated folder.

- name_description_edited.txt is the corrected version of name_description.txt (in outdated folder) 
as it has _v1.1 added to gene IDs.
- Ditto for Kfl_Mat_edit_modified300119.txt in relation to Kfl_Mat_edit_modified150119.txt (in outdated folder) 

3) Kfl_Mat_edit_modified.txt is the correct gene expression file.
Note: modify_JTK_kfl.py script forgets to add 'probeset_id' to index name, which crashes pcc.py
script, corrected it manually.

4) End Jan, edited some scripts to create processed files which retains original gene
IDs exactly. however, Conekt didn't seem to match these IDs, hence used the older processed files
which removed the '_v1.1' and capitalised the first letter, as those worked. Some scripts will
reflect these changes which have not be rolled back.
