These files are where the gene IDs are kept exactly the same as the original, however, Conekt doesn't seem
to match the gene clusters correctly, so I'm not using them.

GO_interproscan_pred_edit.tsv is the updated version of GO_interproscan_pred.tsv as it has "_v1.1" added to it.
Ditto for kfl_aa_conekt_edited300119.fa.tsv in relation to kfl_aa_conekt_edited.fa.tsv.
