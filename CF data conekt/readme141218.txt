1) run_all_CF_data.py was used on all JTK files from CF, which produced a series of output files,
including the modified.txt files, which are used for the pcc.py script.

2) These modified.txt files was copied to the workstation, where a bash script was used, which ran my version
of the pcc.py to generate the coexpression files

3) Output files from 1 and the coexpression files from are stored in folders corresponding to the species name from
CF's data here

4) Cpa and Ppu's JTK files were processed manually to produce the correct output,
as run_all_CF_data.py did not process their gene IDs correctly (wrongly split their strings),
hence in linux their modified.txt and coexpression files are wrong. 

5) JN_pcc.py is MM's pcc.py script, which I modified to make it run on the linux command line

1) When running InterPro, some peptide files have * at the end and Intepro can't handle them,
hence it crashed. Need to rerun for those which crashed

Ran successfully:
ath_aa_conekt_edited.fa
pab_aa_conekt.fa

Ran unsuccessfully:
cpa_aa_conekt.fa
cre_aa_conekt.fa
kfl_aa_conekt.fa
osa_aa_conekt.fa
ppa_aa_conekt.fa
ppu_aa_conekt.fa
smo_aa_conekt.fa

Removed * at the end for the above files which run unsuccessfully, and renamed them as 
XYZ__aa_conekt_edited.fa. Thus for those species which * originally in their peptide
files, there will be both _conekt.fa and _edited.fa files. _edited.fa files produced in
this way will be in a separate interpro folder.

pcc_printout160119.txt is the printout seen when running pcc.py on CF gene expression files.
Since some of them lacked 'probeset_id' as index name, pcc.py script crashed due to
columns not being of the same length, hence added it in and reran pcc.py. This produced
pcc_printout160119_2.txt as the second printout.
