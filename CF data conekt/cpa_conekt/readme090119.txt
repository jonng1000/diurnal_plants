1) species description
Cyanophora paradoxa is a freshwater species of Glaucophyte that is used as a model organism. C. paradoxa has two cyanelles or chloroplasts where photosynthesis occurs. Cyanelles are unusual organelles in that they retain a rudimentary peptidoglycan wall.

2) Initially made cds and peptide sequences follow CF's nomenclature, hence added 'Cpa|' in front
of every gene ID. But Marek said drop it together with redundant (repeated) parts of the gene ID.
Hence evm.model.tig00000017.14 -> tig00000017.14
- remember to change this for CF's JTK files as well.
-> realised that all my other species starts with letters derived from their name, hence to
be consistent, I should start cpa's genes with e.g. Cpa.tig00000017.14, so modified relevant
codes to do this.

Update 10/1/9
MM actually said don't modify anything as I need to be consistent with what other people did,
otherwise when people search for the conventional gene IDs, they would not be able to find them
in my database, hence above in 2) is wrong.

Realised Cyanophora-EVM-CDS-May2016.fasta is good enough for upload hence there's no need to create
cpa_conekt.fa

cpa_aa_conekt.fa has * removed from Cyanophora-EVM-AA-May2016.fasta

3) Mercator has 5 sequences not annotated because its too long.

4) Cpa_Mat_edit_modified150119.txt is the correct gene expression file.
Note: modify_JTK_cpa.py script forgets to add 'probeset_id' to index name, which crashes pcc.py
script, corrected it manually.
