This is the fasta file with 4 genes removed, as they had non-ATCG letters, which causes Mercator
to fail as it says there are protein and nucleotide sequences in my file. After removing
them, Mercator runs successfully, however, it does not annotate my genes, and its output is here.
Also, this was made using cdna file, so its wrong anyway
