1) species description

Selaginella moellendorffii is a lycophyte that is an important model organism, especially in 
comparative genomics. S. moellendorffii is a member of an ancient vascular plant lineage that 
first appeared in the fossil record some 400 million years ago. They would later form a dominant 
part of the world's flora during the Carboniferous period. These lycopsids lack true leaves 
(having microphylls instead) and roots and thus represent an important node on the plant 
evolutionary tree. As the oldest extant division of the vascular plants, they are essential 
to understanding the evolution of plants as a whole.

2) gene descriptions
From JGI Phytozome, there are two different annotation files for the genes, defline.txt and
annotation_info.txt. Based upon discussion with MM (OneNote entry 28/12/18 Update), I will use
annotation_info.txt since that gives more rows of information, and defline.txt seems more like
what InterPro will give, so will ignore it.

3) Smo_Mat_edit_modified160119.txt is the correct gene expression file.
Note: modify_JTK_smo.py script forgets to add 'probeset_id' to index name, which crashes pcc.py
script, corrected it manually.
- gene IDs are "402070" instead of "Smo402070|PACid_15401278"
