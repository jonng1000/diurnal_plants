1) Species description
Porphyridium purpureum is unicellular, mesophilic organism belonging to the red alga (Rhodophyta)
group. Rhodophyta form a monophyletic lineage comprising around 6,100 known species
and 14,000 that are estimated to exist1. These taxa lack both flagella and centrioles
during their life cycle. Rhodophytes include many unicellular mesophilic lineages,
the extremophilic Cyanidiophyceae (for example, Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria) that
live in hot springs such as in Yellowstone National Park, and economically important seaweeds
such as Gracilaria and Pyropia (including Porphyra)3 that are sources of agar and nori,
respectively.

2) Realised Porphyridium_CDS_UPDATED.fasta is good enough for upload hence there's no need to create
ppu_conekt.fa

3) Ppu_Mat_edit_modified160119.txt is the correct gene expression file.
Note: modify_JTK_ppu.py script forgets to add 'probeset_id' to index name, which crashes pcc.py
script, corrected it manually.
