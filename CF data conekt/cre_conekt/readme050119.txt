1) Species description
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a single-cell green alga about 10 micrometres in diameter that swims 
with two flagella. It has a cell wall made of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, 
a large cup-shaped chloroplast, a large pyrenoid, and an "eyespot" that senses light.

Chlamydomonas species are widely distributed worldwide in soil and fresh water. 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an especially well studied biological model organism, partly 
due to its ease of culturing and the ability to manipulate its genetics. When illuminated, 
C. reinhardtii can grow photoautotrophically, but it can also grow in the dark if supplied 
with organic carbon. Commercially, C. reinhardtii is of interest for producing 
biopharmaceuticals and biofuel, as well being a valuable research tool in making hydrogen.

2) v.56 files are used for Conekt upload, v5.5 used by CF, but I've checked it and there's
not much of a difference between v5.6 and CF data, hence I'm using v5.6

3) cre_aa_conekt.fa and cre_conekt.fa are files which I've uploaded to Conekt. But cre_conekt.fa
contains one gene which is too long for Conekt, hence I removed it and made cre_conekt_edit.fa,
which can be uploaded to Conekt. cre_conekt_edit.fa is located in the folder
"/cre_conekt.fa zipped files". Also copied to this folder.

4) Cre_Mat_modified.txt is the correct gene expression file.
Note: modify_JTK_cre.py script forgets to add 'probeset_id' to index name, which crashes pcc.py
script, corrected it manually.

CF JTK file only has unique genes
