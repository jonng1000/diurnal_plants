This file is for my github repo only, just to explain what this repo is. 
The other readme file in this folder explains what its subfolders are. 
This repo is for my diurnal plant coexpression database built for my 1st year PhD project, which is published at
https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/61/1/212/5566499

Folder names (and possibily other ways of organising the data) is not good, e.g. spaces are used in them. This is because
this was when I was just starting my data science journey, hence directory organisation is suboptimal.

Complete directory is stored in my lab's Google Drive, this repo only has the directory structure, .py and readme files.
