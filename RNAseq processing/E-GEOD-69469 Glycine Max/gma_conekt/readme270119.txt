1) Species description
The soybean (Glycine max), or soya bean, is a species of legume native to East Asia, 
widely grown for its edible bean, which has numerous uses.

Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal 
feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable 
protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes. The beans contain 
significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, 
used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. 
Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, from which tofu and tofu 
skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto, and tempeh.

2) Sequences
Previously, used cds file from Ensemble for PCA, kallisto, JTK and creating gene expression file.
However, this used transcript IDs e.g. KRH68680, which is wrong, as the correct IDs for genes
are e.g. Glyma.01G000100. Hence I need to find the correct cds file, which is from JGI Phytozome
as it uses these IDs and clearly labels which file only contains primary transcripts.
