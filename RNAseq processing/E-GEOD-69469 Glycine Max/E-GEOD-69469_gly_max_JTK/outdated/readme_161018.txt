ran JTK on .txt file ending with "_combined_PCA", as it contains the normalised read counts for gene expression
created JTK.E-GEOD-69469, and copied and renamed the copy as JTK.gly_max as this makes it easier for downstream
heatmap and line graph (gene frequencies) generation

E-GEOD-69469_combined_PCA_editJTK.txt is modified from E-GEOD-69469_combined_PCA.txt, but timepoints shifted so that
they are in order for JTK
