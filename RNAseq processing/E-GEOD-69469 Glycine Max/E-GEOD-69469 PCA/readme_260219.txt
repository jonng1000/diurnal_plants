Process of files are as follows:

Original file: E-GEOD-69469_combined.txt which makes E-GEOD-69469_combined_PCA.txt

E-GEOD-69469_colourbar_pre.csv is to convert time points into light and dark
periods.

timepoints_in_cols.py produces timepoints_in_cols.tsv which inserts decimals
into light and dark periods.

E-GEOD-69469_colourbar.csv maps light and dark periods into colour bar values.

PCA 1 plot w colourbar.py uses E-GEOD-69469_combined_PCA.txt and E-GEOD-69469_colourbar.csv
to produce PCA plot.
