previously, around mid-sept 2018, PRJNA295848_annot.txt had many tabs after each row
which produced many NA columns in JTK output, refer to Camilla's email on 021018.
removing these tabs solved this problem

in mid-sept 2018, created a new dataset where all time points had equal replicates, as original
dataset had unequal number of replicates per time point. JTK was run on this new dataset
to see if this solved this problem, however it did not. output from this dataset is stored
in JTK_results_shorter_solpenn

ran JTK on .txt file ending with "_combined_PCA", as it contains the normalised read counts for gene expression
created JTK.PRJNA295848, and copied and renamed the copy as JTK.sol_pen as this makes it easier for downstream
heatmap and line graph (gene frequencies) generation
