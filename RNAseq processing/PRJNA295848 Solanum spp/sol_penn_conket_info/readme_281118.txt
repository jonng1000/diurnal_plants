Whole numbers are gene IDs, the decimal places are splicing isoforms

48923 genes, but 44965 after removing isoforms

1) Species description 
Solanum pennellii is a wild tomato species endemic to Andean regions in South America, 
where it has evolved to thrive in arid habitats. Because of its extreme stress tolerance and 
unusual morphology, it is an important donor of germplasm for the cultivated tomato 
Solanum lycopersicum1.

2) spe_conekt.fa is made using windows. linux_spe_conekt_fa\spe_conekt.fa is made
using linux. Both contain identical information. linux_spe_conekt_fa\spe_conekt.fa.gz
is made from linux_spe_conekt_fa\spe_conekt.fa and its used to upload gene sequences to conekt

Initally, couldn't upload spe_conekt.fa as conekt says 'data too long for column', not sure
why this error occurs. Splitting files and uploading them individually worked,
and they are in upload_seq_error\fasta_splits

However, QW suggested to gzip and upload the whole file, as she normally gzips her files. This
worked. -> Update 150119: this does not work anymore, instead, find and delete gene with the longest
sequence

Conclusion: conekt can't seem to handle text/fasta files that there too long under some
unknown condition, but gzipped files are fine. MM says conekt will unzip gzipped files
and upload their sequences one by one into the database, so since my error doesnt reappear,
this means that conekt has a problem with having large files uploaded, rather
than depositing them in the database.

3) When name_description.txt was first made, isoforms weren't removed hence duplicate genes were present.
Corrected this on 281218 by removing isoforms, hence no more duplicates. This file is now correct.
Need to upload this when I am creating final version of Conekt.

- gene expression and JTK file has isoforms, not removed, but only 10% of data so Marek said its fine
(updated 280519)

4) Add coexpression clusters
Need to set min cluster size to 1, otherwise my clusters will not be ordered in the way in which
I want.
