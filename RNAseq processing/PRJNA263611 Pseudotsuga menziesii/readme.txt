run kallisto quant on 280818 overnight, appears to have been completed successfully, but
Python crashed -> this is fine, don't need to rerun but just check PCA plot in future

took abt 12 h for entire script to run (kallisto index + dl sra data + kallisto quant)

make_sum_table.py along with its required .txt files here are for making the appropriate sample runs ID file for
my gene expression matrix to be created via script
