1) Species description
Pseudotsuga menziesii is an evergreen conifer species in the pine family, Pinaceae. 
It is native to western North America and is known as Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, 
Oregon pine, and Columbian pine. There are two varieties: coast Douglas-fir 
(P. menziesii var. menziesii), and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca).

Marek knows these people and their data is reliable, also they probably removed isoforms.

2) Gene description
select_names_desc_pme.py is produces the gene description file but it has unclear annotations (see OneNote entry
2/1/19) hence I reran it in Mercator to produce better annotations for the gene description file -> don't use this
script. Current name_description.txt file is correct as it has the Mercator output.

3) PRJNA263611_cPJ_edit.txt is made from PRJNA263611_combined_PCA_editJTK.txt -> collapsed 48 h time points
into 24 h

pme_modified.txt is the same as PRJNA263611_cPJ_edit.txt, its just that my create_gene_ex_annotation_pme.py
creates this when it is run.

JTK.pse_men_edit2.txt is made from JTK.pse_men_edit.txt. Basically I just changed the formatting of the time points.
