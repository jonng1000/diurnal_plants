1) Species Description
Brachypodium distachyon, commonly called purple false brome or stiff brome, is 
a grass species native to southern Europe, northern Africa and southwestern Asia east to India. 
It is related to the major cereal grain species wheat, barley, oats, maize, rice, rye, sorghum, 
and millet. It has many qualities that make it an excellent model organism for functional 
genomics research in temperate grasses, cereals, and dedicated biofuel crops such as switchgrass. 
These attributes include small genome (~270 Mbp) diploid accessions, a series of polyploid accessions, 
a small physical stature, self-fertility, a short lifecycle, simple growth requirements, and an 
efficient transformation system. The genome of Brachypodium distachyon (diploid inbred line Bd21) 
has been sequenced and published in Nature in 2010.

2) DRA006158_combined_PCA_JTKedit.txt is modified from DRA006158_combined_PCA_JTK.txt. Basically the 48 h time points are
compressed into 24 h time points.
 - this is the most updated version

3) tissue-specificity: There's only a dark period of 4h, hence eliminated dusk and night, and extended noon, which
has 12 time points now
