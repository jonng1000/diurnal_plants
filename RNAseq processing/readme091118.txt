1) sample_matrix_RNAseq.py script creates a gene expression matrix from the .tsv files from kallisto's output
 - kallisto's output has gene IDs, which ultimately is derived from cds file
 - e.g it produces a gene expression matrix using kallisto's output and E-GEOD-69469_summary, 
 which is labelled as E-GEOD-69469_combined

2) sra_dl_kallisto_quant.py script downloads sra files, runs kallisto quant on them, and then removes these files
 - kallisto process:
 - requires cds file
 - kallisto generates an index file from cds file
 - downloads sra data, then uses index file and sra data to produce kallisto output

3) compare_cds.py used to see whether two different cds files are the same, because sometimes one cds
file doesnt give me enough information, hence i need to use another cds to get what i need


a) kallisto input and outfiles, along with script to dl SRA data is in soybean kallisto folder

b) 270119
Glycine_max.Glycine_max_v2.0.cds.all.fa.gz downloaded from older version of Ensemble Plants in 2018.
In 2019, it got updated to v2.1. My version can be found at:
